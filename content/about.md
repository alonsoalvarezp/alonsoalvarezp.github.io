I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Library Science of Carlos III University of Madrid. I'm a member of the Laboratory of Information Metric Studies (LEMI) and the Research Institute for Higher Education and Science (INAECU). 

My current work concerns the study of inclusion and diversity in science, specially the epistemic and scientometric effects of the current international science communication system. My doctoral work explores these epistemic injustices in the Global South, mainly in Africa. I am also studying the effects of the open science movement, focusing on the inequalities generated by the APC open-access model.

I participate in several projects at the regional, national and european level and collaborate with colleagues at the UC3M, UAM, CWTS, and Campinas University.

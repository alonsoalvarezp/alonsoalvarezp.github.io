# Epistemic injustices in scientific production

This line of work forms part of my dissertation work on identifying epistemic injustices in scientific production, which uses the African academic publication system as a case study. The thesis project addresses the representation, content, and use of science from peripheral regions, relying on international and regional academic databases to contribute to a pluralistic view of global science.

**Abstract**<br>
Based on its perceived objectivity, WoS and Scopus have been largely perceived as sources of journal authority. However, its status has recently been contested due to its linguistic, geographical, and disciplinary biases. This
exploratory analysis specifically studies three quality frameworks: the Web of Science (WoS) journal evaluation process; the Scopus content policy and selection; and the Journal Publishing Practices and Standards (JJPS), employed by the Journals OnLine project (JOL), a network of local journal platforms to help Southern journals increase their global visibility and improve their publishing practices. The analysis shows the existence of similarities between the quality criteria employed by traditional and alternative JIS and the presence of other more subjective factors that depend on the JIS’s priorities and contributes to the discussion on measuring research excellence and offers a new perspective on the objectivity of quality criteria.
